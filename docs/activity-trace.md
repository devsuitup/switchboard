# Activity Trace

A diagnostic trace for the sidebar's activity indicators — the blue braille
spinner, the blue "response ready" dot, the orange attention LED, the purple
subagent glyph, and the green running dot.

Those indicators are driven by two processes with two clocks: the main process
parses OSC sequences off the PTY and watches the filesystem, the renderer keeps
four independent state stores and paints classes. When one of them is wrong,
`main.log` cannot say why — most of the OSC handling logs at `debug`, which a
packaged build never writes, and nothing at all records the renderer side.

The activity trace records **both processes into one ordered file**, so the
question "what did the CLI actually put in the title, and what did the UI do
about it" has a single answer you can read.

**It is off by default and costs nothing when off.** Turn it on only while
investigating.

## Turning it on

```bash
SWITCHBOARD_ACTIVITY_TRACE=1 task dev
```

Accepted values: `1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` (case-insensitive). Anything else —
including unset — leaves the trace off. The variable is read **once**, by the
main process (`activity-trace.js`); the renderer never parses it, it is told
the answer through a launch argument, so the two halves cannot disagree.

The file lands in the app's data directory, next to `switchboard.db`:

| Run | Directory |
|---|---|
| `task dev` / any dev run | `~/.switchboard-dev/` |
| `task test-pr PR=<n>` | `~/.switchboard-dev-pr<n>/` |
| Explicit `SWITCHBOARD_DATA_DIR=...` | that directory |
| Packaged app, no env var | `~/.switchboard/` |

The directory is not re-derived: it is `path.dirname(DB_PATH)`, the single
resolution `db.js` performs, so the trace always lands beside the database it
belongs to. The name is stamped with the launch time — `activity-trace-20260822-141530.jsonl` —
so a new run never overwrites the previous investigation. The main log prints
the full path at startup (`[activity-trace] enabled → ...`).

Nothing is written into the repository.

## Reading a line

One JSON object per line. The first six fields are the envelope, always in this
order, always present; the rest is the probe's payload.

```json
{"seq":417,"t":38214.912,"wall":"2026-08-22T14:20:09.118Z","src":"main","cat":"osc.title","sid":"6f1c…","cp":"U+25D0 U+0020 U+0043","title":"◐ Claude","busy":true,"idle":false,"rule":"glyph","was":false,"decision":"emit:busy"}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `seq` | Monotonic sequence number. **The only reliable ordering.** |
| `t` | Milliseconds since the trace opened, from the main process's monotonic clock. |
| `wall` | Wall-clock ISO timestamp, for correlating with `main.log` and screenshots. |
| `src` | `main` or `renderer` — where the event was observed. |
| `cat` | Probe category (table below). |
| `sid` | The session id the entry is about, or `null`. |

**The main process is the only writer.** The renderer sends its probes over a
fire-and-forget IPC (`activity-trace`) and the main process stamps `seq`, `t`
and `wall` on arrival. That is deliberate: two files with two clocks cannot be
interleaved after the fact, and the ordering is the whole point. The cost is
that a renderer entry's timestamp is its *arrival* time in main, not its
emission time — sub-millisecond in practice, but do not read `t` as renderer
latency.

If a payload field collides with an envelope name, it is stored with a leading
underscore (`_seq`), so `seq` always means the sequence number.

Any probe that names an emission carries **`sent`**: every `webContents.send`
in the app is guarded by `mainWindow && !mainWindow.isDestroyed()`, so a line
saying an event was produced would otherwise be claiming a delivery it never
checked. `sent:false` means the state changed but the renderer was already
gone — normal during shutdown, a real finding at any other time. Probes that
only record an observation (`osc.title`, `osc.progress`, `pty.exit`,
`poll.snapshot`, `subagent.assumed-finished`) make no delivery claim and carry
no `sent`.

## Probe categories

### Main process

| `cat` | Fires when | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `osc.title` | Every OSC 0 title with a payload | `cp`, `title`, `busy`, `idle`, `rule` (`glyph` / `idle-glyph` / `fallback` / `null`), `was`, `decision` |
| `osc.progress` | Every OSC 9;4 progress level (except `4;0`) | `level`, `payload`, `was`, `decision` |
| `osc.notify` | Every non-progress OSC 9 | `message`, `sent` |
| `busy.emit` | A `cli-busy-state` event leaves main | `busy`, `via` (`osc0` / `osc9.4`), `sent` |
| `subagent.spawned` | `subagent-spawned` is sent | `agentId`, `kind` (`spawn` / `heartbeat`), `subagentType`, `ageMs`, `sent` |
| `subagent.assumed-finished` | An unknown transcript is recorded as already finished, **silently** — no IPC | `agentId`, `ageMs`, `bootstrap`, `recheck` |
| `subagent.rehabilitated` | An assumed-finished entry grew inside its recheck window: the withheld spawn is released | `agentId`, `withheldForMs`, `subagentType`, `sent` |
| `subagent.completed` | `subagent-completed` is sent | `agentId`, `stableForMs`, `reason`, `sent` |
| `session.forked` | A fork re-keys a live session | `newId`, `wasBusy`, `sent` |
| `pty.exit` | The PTY exits | `exitCode`, `alsoUnder`, `wasBusy` |
| `poll.snapshot` | `get-active-sessions` answers | `count`, `entries` |
| `app.quit` | Last line of a clean shutdown | — |

### Renderer

| `cat` | Fires when | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `recv.*` | An IPC event arrives (`cli-busy-state`, `terminal-notification`, `session-forked`, `session-detected`, `process-exited`, `subagent-spawned`, `subagent-completed`) | per event |
| `recv.subagent-spawned` | …with `applied` telling whether it changed anything. `applied:false` + `reason:"heartbeat-for-untracked-agent"` is a heartbeat deliberately dropped | `agentId`, `applied`, `bootstrap`, `heartbeat`, `from` |
| `store.mutate` | A state store changes | `map`, `op`, `from`, `to`, `fn`, `via` |
| `store.skip` | A write was **refused** by a guard | `map`, `reason`, `fn` |
| `store.purge` | State dropped because the PTY is gone | `reason`, `busy`, `ready`, `attention` |
| `store.rekey` | Activity state carried across a fork | `from`, `busy`, `ready`, `attention` |
| `subagents.prune` | The 60 s TTL sweep ran | `parents`, `agents` |
| `class.apply` | `cli-busy` / `response-ready` written | `el`, both class states |
| `class.toggle` | `needs-attention` / `has-running-pty` written | `el`, `cls`, `on` |
| `class.subagent` | Subagent `running` / `has-running-child` / `has-busy-agents` written | `el` ids, `running` |
| `class.render` | A full sidebar render reconstructed an item's classes from the stores | `el`, `cls` |
| `poll.recv` | The poll reply reaches the renderer | `sinceSeq`, `entries` |
| `reconcile.apply` / `reconcile.skip` / `reconcile.noop` | Per session in the poll reply | `backend`, `local`, `reason`, `sinceSeq`, `sessionSeq` |

`store.mutate` carries `fn` (the function that wrote) and, for `setActivity`,
`via` (the caller that asked). `setActivity`'s third argument exists only for
this — it is inert when the trace is off.

## What the trace is for

Three questions it answers that nothing else can:

**Does the CLI's title still match the busy test?** This is the question the
trace was built for, and the first run of it (2026-08-22) found the test broken:
over the first ten minutes of that trace, 623 of 628 OSC 0 titles started with
`U+25D0` / `U+25D1` and were marked `ignored:no-match`, and every busy transition
was attributed to `via:"osc9.4"` — the title could only turn the spinner *off*.
Quote a window, not a total, if you cite your own run: the file grows for as long
as the variable is set. Recheck after a
CLI upgrade, because the glyphs are the CLI's private business and it has
changed them before:

```bash
# Leading code points, and what the detector made of them
jq -r 'select(.cat=="osc.title") | "\(.cp | split(" ")[0])\t\(.rule)\t\(.decision)"' $TRACE | sort | uniq -c

# Where busy transitions actually came from — `osc0` must appear
jq -r 'select(.cat=="busy.emit" and .busy==true) | .via' $TRACE | sort | uniq -c
```

Spinner frames reading `rule:"fallback"` mean the CLI moved to glyphs the range
table in `classify-title-activity.js` does not list yet — still detected, worth
adding. `ignored:no-match` on a title that visibly carries a prefix means the
fallback itself regressed. No `osc0` in the second count means the title channel
is dead again and the indicator is riding on the progress-bar setting alone. The
full argument is in [`.ai/contexts/ipc-bridge.md`](../.ai/contexts/ipc-bridge.md),
"The OSC 0 title is the primary busy channel".

**Was an event suppressed, or never sent?** `osc.title` records the verdict
(`emit:*` vs `suppressed:*`) and `busy.emit` records the actual send. A
`decision` of `emit:busy` with no `busy.emit` right after it is a bug in the
emitting branch; `suppressed:already-busy` is working as intended.

> **Expect a burst at startup.** The first scan of a session emits one
> `subagent.assumed-finished` line per historical transcript — a project with a
> thousand of them produces a thousand lines in a single pass, before anything
> interesting has happened. They all carry `bootstrap:true`, and later scans
> produce none (the directory-mtime cache skips known files), so filter them
> out when you are reading a startup problem:
> `jq -c 'select(.bootstrap != true)' $TRACE`.

**Is a subagent's state the truth or an assumption?** A transcript first seen
already stale is recorded as finished without any event — `subagent.assumed-finished`
is the only record that it happened. When `recheck` is `true` that verdict is a
guess (the sighting may simply have been late), and a later
`subagent.rehabilitated` line is the guess being retracted, with `withheldForMs`
saying how long the spawn was suppressed. A parent whose indicator is wrong
usually has one of these two lines behind it.

**Did the UI receive it and act?** Follow the `seq` numbers: `busy.emit` →
`recv.cli-busy-state` → `store.mutate` → `class.apply`. A chain that stops
early localises the fault to one process. `store.skip` and `reconcile.skip`
name the guard that dropped the value.

### Useful filters

```bash
TRACE=~/.switchboard-dev/activity-trace-*.jsonl

# Which code points does the CLI actually send, and what did the detector decide?
jq -r 'select(.cat=="osc.title") | "\(.cp)\t\(.rule)\t\(.decision)"' $TRACE | sort | uniq -c

# Everything about one session, in order
jq -c 'select(.sid=="6f1c…")' $TRACE

# Every state write that was refused, and by which guard
jq -c 'select(.cat=="store.skip" or .cat=="reconcile.skip")' $TRACE

# Everything the subagent detector decided, in order, minus the startup burst
jq -c 'select((.cat | startswith("subagent.")) and .bootstrap != true)' $TRACE

# Events the app produced but never delivered (renderer already gone)
jq -c 'select(.sent == false)' $TRACE

# Subagent events the renderer received but deliberately dropped
jq -c 'select(.cat=="recv.subagent-spawned" and .applied==false)' $TRACE

# Emission vs reception, side by side
jq -c 'select(.cat=="busy.emit" or .cat=="recv.cli-busy-state")' $TRACE
```

## Cost when disabled

Nothing is built, sent, or written.

- **Main process** — `SWITCHBOARD_ACTIVITY_TRACE` is read once at require time
  into a `const TRACE`. Every probe is `if (TRACE) trace(...)`, so with the
  trace off the payload literal is never evaluated. The `activity-trace` IPC
  handler is not even registered.
- **Renderer** — `preload.js` resolves the same flag and exposes it as
  `window.api.activityTraceEnabled`; `public/activity-trace.js` reduces it to
  `window.ATRACE`. Probes are `if (window.ATRACE) window.atrace(...)`: one
  property load, no allocation, no IPC.
- The trace function also short-circuits on its own first line, so a stray
  call from anywhere is inert.

`test/activity-trace.test.js` and `test/activity-trace-renderer.test.js` pin
this: a disabled trace never advances its sequence counter, never opens a file,
and never reads a payload property (the tests hand it an object with a
throwing/counting getter).

This matters because of
[ADR 0002](decisions/0002-discrete-steps-sidebar-animations.md) — the
indicators were rebuilt to stop burning CPU at idle, and a diagnostic that
allocated on every render would undo that. Even when the trace is **on**, no
probe sits on the terminal render path: the busiest is `osc.title`, which fires
only for chunks containing an OSC introducer.

## Disk use

Bounded. The trace writes to at most 4 rotating segments of 16 MB each — a
64 MB ceiling by default, so it can be left on overnight. When the cap is
reached the oldest segment is deleted; the tail is what you read.

If that deletion fails — most plausibly because you have a `tail` or an editor
open on the segment, which is exactly what an investigation looks like — the
file stays queued and is retried at the next rotation, and a
`trace.prune-failed` line records it. So the ceiling can be temporarily
exceeded, but never silently: grep the trace for `prune-failed` if disk use
surprises you.

```bash
# 256 MB ceiling instead of 64
SWITCHBOARD_ACTIVITY_TRACE=1 SWITCHBOARD_ACTIVITY_TRACE_MAX_MB=256 task dev
```

Writes go through an append-only stream and are never read back. The stream
buffers, so a slow disk delays the trace instead of blocking the main thread —
the trade is that the last few lines may be lost on a hard crash. A clean quit
flushes and closes (`app.quit` is the last line).
