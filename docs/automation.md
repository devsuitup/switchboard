# Automation

Switchboard can run Claude tasks without you at the keyboard, through two complementary mechanisms:

- **Schedules** — cron-style recurring tasks defined as Markdown files, fired by an in-process scheduler.
- **Triggers** — one-shot command injection into an already-open session, driven by dropping a JSON file. Meant for external scripts and harnesses.

## Schedules

A schedule is a Markdown file at `<project>/.claude/commands/schedule-*.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: My morning audit
cron: 0 9 * * 1-5
enabled: true
slug: morning-audit
cli:
  permission-mode: acceptEdits
  allowed-tools: Bash,Read,Write
---

<Full self-contained prompt that Claude will execute>
```

When the cron expression matches, Switchboard pre-seeds a new session with the prompt and spawns `claude --resume <sid> -p "..."` headlessly. The run appears as a regular session in the sidebar — open it there to see the result.

### Creating a schedule

Click the **clock icon** on a project in the sidebar. This opens an interactive Claude session pre-loaded with a schedule-creator command: describe what you want scheduled, and Claude writes the `schedule-*.md` file for you. You can also write the file by hand — the scheduler rescans every minute, so changes take effect within 60 seconds, no restart needed.

Existing schedules are listed in the project's brain tab (Memory panel), each with a **run now** button that fires it immediately, bypassing the cron match.

### Behavior and limits

- `enabled: false` disables a schedule without deleting it.
- `cron` is standard 5-field syntax (minute, hour, day-of-month, month, day-of-week) with `*`, lists, ranges, and steps. No `@daily` aliases, no DST awareness (times are local).
- `permission-mode: acceptEdits` (or `auto`) is the practical default — headless `-p` runs hang on any permission prompt otherwise.
- One run at a time per schedule: if a run is still going when the next tick matches, that tick is silently skipped.
- The scheduler lives in-process: **if Switchboard isn't running, the schedule doesn't fire.** It's a personal tool, not a daemon.

## Triggers

The trigger watcher lets any external script type into an open session's terminal — no Electron IPC required. Drop a JSON file into `~/.switchboard/triggers/` (override with `SWITCHBOARD_TRIGGERS_DIR`):

```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc-123-def",
  "command": "/compact",
  "wait": "idle",
  "timeout_ms": 120000
}
```

- `sessionId` — the target session (must be open in Switchboard).
- `command` — written to the PTY, followed by a discrete Enter keypress.
- `wait` — `"none"` (default) does not wait for the session to stop being busy; `"idle"` does. Neither sends into a composer with unsubmitted input: see "Politeness" — `"none"` can still wait, up to `timeout_ms`. Use `"idle"` for anything that must not interrupt a mid-response stream.
- `timeout_ms` — optional cap on the waiting, idle **and politeness** (≤ 600 000 ms; default 300 000). See "Politeness" below: with `wait: "none"` this is the only bound on how long a trigger sits waiting for a free composer. On a `chain` it is the deadline for the **whole chain**, not for each step — see "A chain's deadline is one budget for every step".
- `expectedCwd` — optional. See "Target guard" below.

Environment overrides: `SWITCHBOARD_TRIGGERS_DIR` (watched directory), `SWITCHBOARD_TRIGGER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default idle wait), `SWITCHBOARD_TRIGGER_QUIET_MS` (the politeness quiet window, default 3000 ms), `SWITCHBOARD_TRIGGER_MAX_AGE_MS` (the staleness limit, default 300 000 ms).

**A trigger file older than the staleness limit is refused unread.** Age is the
file's own `mtime` against the moment the watcher inspects it, so a trigger that
ages out while queued is refused exactly like one that was already stale when the
watcher found it: a `/compact` written six hours ago no longer targets the same
session state. The refusal is an ordinary result — `{"ok": false, "submitted":
"no", "error": "not sent"}` with the age in `reason`. A trigger written while
Switchboard was closed is not lost: a startup scan picks it up at the next
launch, and the limit is what decides — it runs if it is still inside the
window, and is refused if it has aged past it.

Instead of a single `command`, you can send a `chain` — a sequence of up to 20 steps injected one after another, each submitted and verified before the next:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "abc-123-def",
  "chain": [{ "command": "/compact" }],
  "wait": "none"
}
```

`command` and `chain` are mutually exclusive.

**A chain's deadline is one budget for every step.** `timeout_ms` — or its
300 000 ms default — is a single deadline taken at the start and shared by the
initial wait, every step's politeness wait, every submit verification, and the
busy-fall wait that separates one step from the next. It is not restarted per
step. A step may narrow its own share with its own `timeout_ms`; it can never
extend it past the chain's deadline — and a per-step value above the 600 000 cap
is refused outright, not clamped, taking the whole trigger with it.

The cap is enforced on the `timeout_ms` field only. When the field is absent the
budget comes from `SWITCHBOARD_TRIGGER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, which is not capped: an
env var set above 600 000 gives every chain on that machine a larger budget than
any trigger may ask for.

Size it against what the steps actually do, not against how many there are. A
chain that compacts and then resumes spends most of its budget waiting for the
session to go idle after `/compact`, and the default leaves little room for the
resume step: `{"chain": [{"command": "/compact"}, {"command": "…"}],
"timeout_ms": 600000}` is the shape that fits, 600 000 being the cap.

A session that is busy for another reason spends the budget just as fast —
anything typed into it while a chain is in flight competes with the chain's own
steps for the same deadline.

**`waited_ms` / `total_waited_ms`.** Both fields mean the same thing — every
wait this trigger spent — scoped differently: a single `command` result
carries `waited_ms` for the whole trigger; a `chain` result carries
`total_waited_ms` for the whole chain, plus a per-step `waited_ms` inside each
`steps[]` entry.

- **`command`'s `waited_ms`** is the `wait:"idle"` wait (0 if `wait` is
  `"none"` or the session was already idle), plus the politeness wait, plus
  the submit-verification poll and its retry, if one fired.
- **`chain`'s `total_waited_ms`** is the initial `wait:"idle"` wait (same rule)
  plus, for every step the chain attempted, that step's own politeness wait,
  its submit-verification poll(s), and — for every step but the last — its
  busy-fall wait. `steps[i].waited_ms` is the same sum scoped to step `i`
  alone, so `total_waited_ms` equals the initial wait plus the sum of every
  entry in `steps[]`, **except** when the last attempted step is abandoned
  before it ever writes anything because the session exits or the global
  deadline fires: that step's partial wait still counts toward
  `total_waited_ms`, but it has no entry in `steps[]` to be attributed to. A
  step refused for a composer that never frees is **not** this exception
  (narrowed 2026-09-05, was previously grouped with the other two): it now
  gets its own `steps[]` entry too — `submitted: "no"`, `submit_retries: 0` —
  so its politeness wait is attributed exactly like a step that did write.
  The remaining exception (session exit, global deadline, both checked before
  a step's own politeness wait even starts) was left alone: unlike the
  composer case, neither has a `stepSentAt`-scoped wait of its own worth
  attributing to a step that was never even reached.

A measured gap of roughly 158 s between `total_waited_ms` and the sum of
`steps[*].waited_ms` on 2026-09-03 was this: each step's own politeness wait
was folded into `total_waited_ms` but left out of that step's own
`waited_ms` — fixed so the identity above holds exactly on every chain that
completes. The `command` path had the matching gap on its own smaller scale —
its `waited_ms` left out the submit-verification poll entirely — fixed the
same way, so a reader comparing the two paths finds them consistent.

`wait` accepts **`idle` and `none`, and nothing else.** An absent field still
means `none`, because existing triggers rely on that default, but any other
value — an empty string, `null`, `"idel"` — is refused before anything is
written, with a `reason` naming the value received. Falling back to `none` on a
typo would send immediately into a session that asked to be waited for, which is
the more dangerous of the two behaviours.

### Politeness: Switchboard never types over you

**Nothing is written into a session that has input typed and not submitted.**
A trigger arriving while you are mid-sentence waits, and if it never gets a free
composer before its deadline it renounces rather than splice its payload into
your words.

This is not only courtesy. A slash command injected into a **non-empty**
composer never submits at all: Claude Code submits `/compact` through the
completion menu, which opens only when the `/` is the first character of an
empty box. A session once slept nine hours with an inert `/compact` sitting in
its composer. Politeness is the condition under which the channel works.

**How Switchboard knows.** It models the box. Every keystroke the renderer sends
reaches the main process through one IPC channel, and `composer-state.js` keeps
a running copy of the text it believes is sitting there, plus a cursor into it.
`pending` is that text's length in **code points**, so an emoji weighs one and
one backspace removes it.

A counter could only add and subtract; a model can be edited. What is applied:

| Input | Effect on the model |
|---|---|
| printable bytes, pasted bytes, `ESC [ 200 ~` … `ESC [ 201 ~` content | inserted at the cursor — a paste's embedded carriage returns are text, and do **not** clear the box |
| Enter, newline, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+C | clears |
| Backspace / DEL, `ESC [ 3 ~` (Delete) | removes one code point behind / ahead of the cursor |
| Ctrl+W, Alt+Backspace | removes the word before the cursor |
| Ctrl+K | removes from the cursor to the end |
| Left / Right (`ESC [ C`, `ESC O C`, …), Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Home, End | move the cursor; a modified Left/Right moves by a word |
| bare Up (`ESC [ A`, `ESC O A`), Ctrl+V, an unparseable escape | insert one opaque placeholder — the content is unknown, so it counts as one |
| kitty Enter **with** a modifier (`ESC [ 13;2 u`, `ESC [ 13;5 u`) | inserts a line break |
| kitty Enter **without** one (`ESC [ 13 u`), modified Up, OSC, other escapes | nothing |
| SGR mouse reports (`ESC [ < b ; x ; y M`/`m`), focus reports (`ESC [ I`, `ESC [ O`) | nothing — **and the quiet clock does not move**; these two forms are the terminal talking, not the user |

An escape sequence cut across two IPC chunks is buffered and re-joined, so half
a sequence is never counted as text — including a lone `ESC` that turns out to
be the first byte of the next chunk's bracketed paste. A sequence that cannot be
parsed at all counts as input: **doubt resolves to busy**, always.

The composer is called free only when `pending` is zero **and** nothing has
arrived on that channel for `SWITCHBOARD_TRIGGER_QUIET_MS` (default 3000). The
freshness window covers the one case the model cannot: an Enter that validates a
slash-command completion empties the box while the CLI refills it.

**Where this is blind — stated, not papered over:**

- Only bytes coming from the renderer are seen. Input reaching the PTY by any
  other route is invisible to the model.
- The model is a **line editor's** model, not the CLI's. It knows nothing of
  wrapping, of multi-line navigation, or of any binding Claude Code adds beyond
  the table above; an unmodelled editing key leaves the text longer than the box
  really is. That over-count is the safe direction — the trigger renounces —
  but it stays until the next Enter, Ctrl+U or Ctrl+C, and until then every
  trigger for that session renounces.
- Ctrl+U is treated as clearing the whole box, which is right when the cursor is
  at the end. Used mid-line it would be an under-count if the CLI binds it to
  "kill to start of line" — unmeasured.
- Any chunk carrying something other than a recognised terminal report restarts
  the quiet clock, whether or not it changes the text. Mouse and focus reports
  are the exception, and they had to be: a TUI with mouse reporting on
  (`CSI ?1003h`) emits one report per pointer motion, on the same IPC channel as
  keystrokes, and until 2026-09-02 each of them pushed the clock. **Measured that
  day on the real CLI**, composer emptied with Ctrl+U, no key touched: pointer
  resting *over* the terminal, a trigger waited its full 30 s and was then
  refused — `{"ok":false,"reason":"the last keystroke landed 47 ms ago, inside
  the 3000 ms quiet window","waited_ms":30046}`; pointer moved *off* the
  terminal, the same trigger took `waited_ms":15504` to find 3 s of silence. The
  earlier claim here — "at most ~3 s each time, never a refusal on its own" —
  was wrong: with the user simply present at the machine, triggers were
  unusable. Reports now count as neither text nor activity, so a chunk holding
  only reports changes nothing at all, clock included. The exemption is
  deliberately narrow: SGR reports (`CSI < b ; x ; y M|m`) and focus reports
  (`CSI I`, `CSI O`) with no parameter — those two forms and nothing else. A
  near-miss — a parameter too few or too many, a non-numeric one, another final
  byte, a report cut short by the end of a chunk — is *not* recognised and still
  counts as input. Doubt resolves to busy here too: a wrong exemption would be a
  false "free", and a false "free" types over the user's sentence.
- The exemption covers those two forms only, and xterm.js writes more than
  reports on that channel. Its own replies still count as input and still push
  the quiet clock (measured: `lastInputAt` stamped, `pending` unchanged) — the
  OSC colour reply `ESC ] 11 ; rgb:… ST`, the XTWINOPS size replies
  `CSI 4 ; h ; w t` and `CSI 6 ; ch ; cw t`, DA1 (`CSI ?1;2c`) and CPR
  (`CSI r ; c R`). Each costs a trigger up to one quiet window. **Their
  periodicity has not been verified**: they answer a query, so they are
  presumably one-off rather than repeating — that is a reserve, not a
  guarantee.
- In the alternate screen buffer with mouse tracking *off*, xterm translates the
  wheel into arrow keys and sends them as ordinary input. A bare `ESC [ A` is a
  history recall to this model, so it inserts one opaque placeholder: **three
  wheel notches put `pending` at 3** (measured) and every trigger for that
  session renounces until the next Enter, Ctrl+U or Ctrl+C. The direction is the
  safe one — the trigger gives up rather than typing over something — but this
  is the next "the trigger never fires", and it is not fixed here: deciding what
  a wheel-driven arrow key means to the composer is a change of its own.
- Escape does **not** clear the composer on Claude Code v2.1.258 (measured), so
  treating it as neutral is correct *today*. A CLI change would turn it into a
  false "free".
- An Enter that validates a completion menu empties the model although the box
  is still full. Only the quiet window covers that.
- A composer filled by the CLI itself — a prompt, a queued message, a resumed
  draft — was never typed and is not counted.
- **Modified Up arrows are not counted, and on Claude Code v2.1.258 that is
  correct — as a dated measurement, not a guarantee.** Measured on an isolated
  PTY with a screen dump: plain `ESC [ A` and `ESC O A` do recall history (the
  screen shows `─── History 2/2 ───` and the previous command lands back in the
  box), which is why the model inserts one placeholder for them. `ESC [ 1;2 A` (Shift+Up),
  `ESC [ 1;3 A` (Alt+Up) and `ESC [ 1;5 A` (Ctrl+Up) leave the box empty, so not
  counting them is not an undercount on this version. A CLI release that gave
  those chords a meaning would reopen an undercount — and undercounting is the
  dangerous direction: it reads a full composer as free.
- A triggers directory whose path contains an 8.3 short name (`JEAN-B~1`) kills
  the process outright: `fs.watch`/libuv asserts. Use the long path.

The guard applies to every write, including the bare recovery Enter the watcher
sends when it saw no turn start — on a half-typed sentence that Enter would
submit the sentence. When politeness never allows a write, the result is
`{ "ok": false, "submitted": "no", "error": "not sent", "reason": "…" }`.

**What this costs `wait: "none"`.** It no longer means "write now": against a
non-empty composer it waits, and the only bound is `timeout_ms` — 300 000 ms by
default. For all of that time the trigger holds one of the 8 concurrent slots
(`MAX_INFLIGHT`), so a handful of triggers aimed at sessions whose users walked
away mid-sentence can stall the queue for every other session. Set a short
`timeout_ms` on triggers that would rather renounce than wait.

**Two triggers naming the same session never run at once.** `MAX_INFLIGHT`
bounds how many trigger *files* the watcher processes in parallel; it says
nothing about which sessions they target. Two triggers aimed at the same
`sessionId` are serialized independently of that cap — the second waits for
the first's result to be written before it so much as samples that session's
`busy` state — so their writes can never land in the same composer
interleaved. Triggers aimed at different sessions are unaffected and keep
running in parallel, still bounded only by `MAX_INFLIGHT`. A trigger's own
`timeout_ms` / idle-wait deadline is what still bounds how long a second
trigger for the same session can end up waiting — nothing here waits longer
than that.

### Reading a result

Every path that decides a trigger's fate — success, validation refusal, timeout,
missing session, refused `wait` — writes the result to
`~/.switchboard/triggers/processed/<name>.result.json` and then deletes the
trigger file. For a chain that happens once the whole chain has ended, not step
by step — so a trigger file still sitting in `~/.switchboard/triggers/` with no
result yet is normally **in flight, not failed**. Normally, and not always: a
watcher whose `fs.watch` or directory setup failed at startup leaves the same
picture, and so does a name the watcher could not read — both are logged and
neither produces a result. A caller that polls for one needs a bound of its own.
The triggers directory therefore holds the triggers still waiting to be
processed, or being processed right now:

```json
{ "ok": true,  "submitted": "activity", "sessionId": "...", "command": "...", "sent_at": "...", "waited_ms": 320 }
{ "ok": false, "submitted": "no", "error": "not sent", "reason": "4 byte(s) of input are sitting unsubmitted in the composer" }
```

**`submitted` is the field to read, not `ok`.** A payload written into a
composer is not a message received. Four values, compared by strict equality,
in this order (`no` < `assumed` < `activity` < `confirmed`):

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `confirmed` | the composer was read back empty right after our own Enter, the session was **not** already busy the instant we wrote, and a turn was independently observed in the same window — checked on the first attempt only, never after a retry |
| `activity` | the session was seen busy after our write, but the composer readback could not rule out interference, or the session was already mid-turn when we wrote |
| `assumed` | written, no failure seen, nothing observed afterwards |
| `no` | nothing was written, or it was written and not submitted |

A `chain` reports the **weakest** value any of its steps reached — this is the
field's meaning unchanged from before per-step values existed, kept for
compatibility with readers written against it. Since 2026-09-05, every entry
in `steps[]` also carries its own `submitted`, classified the same way and
compared on the same four-value order. Read it when you need to know whether
one specific step — most often the *last* one, e.g. a resume prompt at the end
of a `/compact` chain — was itself confirmed, rather than whether the chain as
a whole cleared some bar: a chain reporting `"assumed"` overall says nothing
about which step dragged it down; `steps[i].submitted` does. A step refused
before it ever reached a write (composer never free) still gets an entry, with
`submitted: "no"` — see the `steps[]` exception below, narrowed the same day.

**What `activity` refuses to claim, and what a bare composer reading cannot
prove on its own.** Busy is sampled, not compared against a baseline taken
before the write, and nothing ties it to that write: a session already
mid-turn when the trigger fires reads busy on the very first sample. Reading
the composer back does not close that gap by itself either — the composer
model only ever sees bytes the renderer sends (see "Politeness" above); this
transport's own writes go straight to the PTY and are invisible to it. So "the
composer reads empty after our write" only proves no *human's* unsubmitted
sentence is visible at that instant; it says nothing about whether the CLI
consumed what we ourselves just wrote, since the model never knew that text
existed. `confirmed` is only granted when that reading is paired with two more
things: the session was **not** already busy when we wrote (a session mid-turn
can swallow or queue injected text with the composer model none the wiser),
and a turn was still independently observed. Even then, a turn starting says
nothing about *what* the CLI made of the text — a slash command that misses
the CLI's completion menu is submitted as an ordinary message whose text
merely starts with `/`, and that message produces a turn too. Only reading
back the effect you asked for distinguishes those, and no transport in this
repository does that.

So a caller that must not act twice on the same intent still has to check the
effect itself — a smaller context window, a new transcript, a file on disk —
even when `submitted` reads `confirmed`; treat `confirmed` as "the handoff to
the session went through cleanly", and `activity` as "something happened,
unattributed".

**What `confirmed` proves, stated exactly, and the one thing it does not.**
`confirmed` means three checked facts and nothing more: the session was idle
the instant before we wrote, a turn was observed within the verify window
after that write, and this was the first attempt (no retry). **It does not
prove that the turn it observed is the one our write started.**
`pollForBusyObserved` is a level probe over the whole window, not an edge
tied to our write — any `busy` transition inside that window satisfies it,
regardless of what caused it. A second trigger on the same session, a human
resuming, or any other actor going busy inside the same window produces
`confirmed` exactly as our own write would. Serializing triggers per session
(above) closes the same-session case at the source — the second trigger
cannot even attempt a write until the first has fully finished — but an
actor outside this transport's own admission queue (a human, another
process) is not something a PTY byte stream can distinguish from our own
effect. **A false `confirmed` remains reachable in that case: it is narrowed
by construction, never eliminated.**

> **Changed — read this if you parse `submitted`.**
> `confirmed` used to be emitted whenever the session was seen busy after a
> write, which asserted more than the transport could know (a session already
> mid-turn satisfied it in milliseconds, with a turn the write did not cause).
> That case reported `activity` for a time, and `confirmed` was reserved and
> never emitted. `confirmed` is back, gated as described above, so a reader
> testing `submitted === 'confirmed'` matches again — on a narrower, verified
> case than before. A reader testing `submitted === 'no'` or
> `submitted !== 'no'` is unaffected by any of this.

**`error` is compared by strict equality too**, so explanations go in `reason`
and never into `error`: `not sent: input pending` is not `not sent`. `reason`
carries the detail alone, and carries it for every failure — a reader that wants
to know *why* reads `reason`, never a substring of `error`.

| `error` | What it promises the reader | What the emitter does with it |
|---|---|---|
| `not sent` | **not one byte reached the session.** No idle ever came, politeness never allowed a write, or the trigger was refused before any write | nothing to assume about: the harness **voids** the pending guard, and the next turn forces again on its own |
| `chain timeout` | at least one step **was written**, and the expected effect was not observed before the deadline | the effect is only assumed, so the harness **keeps blocking** the next compaction |
| anything else | free text: `session not found`, `pty write failed: …`, a validation refusal | read `submitted` to know whether anything landed |

The two reserved values are easy to confuse and mean opposite things, so:

- A chain whose first step landed and whose second was held back by politeness
  reports `chain timeout`, never `not sent`.
- A `wait: "idle"` that expires without the session ever going idle reports
  `not sent` with `reason: "timeout waiting for idle; nothing was written"`,
  and `partial: false` — never `chain timeout`. This is the commonest failure
  in service: a session reports itself busy for as long as any delegated agent
  runs, so `idle` is regularly unsatisfiable, and answering `chain timeout`
  there would block every later compaction over a payload that never left.
- The same holds when the session exits during that initial wait: the `error`
  stays the free-text `session exited during wait`, but `submitted` is `no`,
  `partial` is `false`, and `reason` says nothing was written.

**A truncated chain: reading which steps went out.** `steps_completed` counts
steps whose wait *completed*. A step that was written and whose wait then hit
the deadline gets an entry in `steps[]` and is **not** counted — so a chain that
sent `/compact` and timed out waiting for the session to come back reports
`steps_completed: 0` with one entry in `steps[]`. Read as "nothing went out",
that sends `/compact` a second time.

Read the array, not the count. `steps[]` holds the steps the chain **reached**,
which is not the same as the steps it wrote: a step whose politeness wait never
found a free composer is recorded too, and nothing was written for it. That
entry is recognisable — **`submitted: "no"` on a step means it was never
written**, and it is the only way a step entry carries that value.

So, with `steps_total` the chain's length, carried on every chain result:

- the last entry, when its `submitted` is `"no"`, was **not** sent: the unsent
  tail starts at that entry's own `idx`;
- otherwise the last entry was sent, and the tail starts at `max(steps[].idx) + 1`;
- either way the tail runs to `steps_total - 1`;
- with no entry at all, the whole chain is the tail.

Taking `max(steps[].idx) + 1` unconditionally is the mistake that loses a resume
prompt held back by politeness — the case `steps_total` exists to make visible.

An empty `steps: []` and a missing `steps` key both mean nothing went out; they
distinguish a refusal inside the chain loop from one that never reached it, and
the same `error` value can appear in either. Read it as
`(result.steps || []).length === 0`, not as `result.steps.length === 0`.

**An exception anywhere while deciding a trigger's fate** — not just the
anticipated validation refusals above — still ends in a result file and a
deletion. A trigger body that parses as valid JSON but isn't a usable shape
(the bare value `null`, a `chain` step that isn't an object) is caught and
reported as `{ "ok": false, "error": "internal error: <message>", "internal":
true }`, rather than left on disk with no result at all. `internal: true` is
set on this path only — a validation refusal never carries it — so a reader
can tell "our code broke" apart from "the trigger was refused" without
parsing `error`, which stays reserved for the strict-equality checks above.

**When the deletion itself fails** (permissions, a locked file, an entry that is
not a regular file), the trigger stays on disk. The result file is still
written, the failure is logged at error level, and that name is remembered for
the lifetime of the process so a later filesystem event on it can never run the
command a second time — the leftover file is inert, not pending. A trigger whose
name sits in `processed/` has been processed, whatever the trigger directory
still shows. This is the only case that leaves a name non-replayable; an
internal exception on its own does not — once the result is written and the
trigger deleted, a later trigger dropped under the same name is a fresh
attempt.

**`processed/` has no retention policy**: result files accumulate there for as
long as the directory lives, and nothing in the app ever removes them. Callers
that write many triggers should prune it themselves.

The primary use case is context-management harnesses — e.g. an agent hook that detects a full context window and injects `/compact` into its own session. Write the trigger file atomically (write to a temp name, then rename) so the watcher never reads a half-written file.

### Target guard

`sessionId` alone is not proof the trigger is aimed where the writer thinks:
a valid id naming an open session looks identical whether it was chosen
correctly or picked up a race (two sessions writing their transcript at the
same instant, one trigger addressing the wrong one — a real incident). The
optional `expectedCwd` field lets the writer state what it believes the
target session's working directory is, checked before anything is written:

```json
{ "sessionId": "abc-123-def", "command": "/compact", "expectedCwd": "C:\\Projects\\my-worktree" }
```

- **Absent** — no change from today: nobody declared an expectation, so
  nothing is checked.
- **Present and it matches** the session's actual cwd (case, `/` vs `\`, a
  trailing slash and the Windows long-path prefix are all normalized first)
  — the trigger proceeds exactly as it would without the field.
- **Present and it disagrees** — refused before any write:
  `{ "ok": false, "submitted": "no", "error": "not sent", "targetMismatch": true, "expectedCwd": "...", "observedCwd": "..." }`.
- **Present but the session's cwd cannot be determined** — refused the same
  way, `targetCwdUnknown: true` instead of `targetMismatch`, so a reader can
  tell "disagreement" from "couldn't check" without parsing `reason`. This is
  deliberate: a check that silently lets the trigger through when it cannot
  verify would reopen the exact hole it exists to close.

**What this does not protect against.** The comparison is by folder. Two
sessions open in the *same* directory are not distinguished by it — the guard
narrows the incident it was built for (two different worktrees), it does not
generally solve "which of several sessions in one folder did the writer
mean". It also does not resolve 8.3 short names, `subst` drives, or
junctions/symlinks to their real target — two spellings of the same real
folder in any of those forms are treated as a mismatch, not folded together.
