# Context: viewer-panel

**Purpose**: Reusable CodeMirror-based file viewer with a configurable toolbar. Used by **2 callsites** in `public/app.js`: `memoryPanel` (Memory tab), `workFilesPanel` (.work-files tab). Optionally read-only or savable. Watches the file on disk and auto-reloads on external changes.

## Key files

| File | LOC | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `public/viewer-panel.js` | ~415 | The `ViewerPanel` class. Owns CodeMirror state, toolbar wiring, file watch lifecycle, save/format/delete logic. |
| `public/viewer-toolbar.js` | ~265 | Pure factory `createViewerToolbar(opts)` — builds the toolbar DOM + returns API. No state of its own. |

## Public surface

```js
// Construction
const panel = new ViewerPanel(container, {
  copyPath: bool,         // show copy-path button
  copyContent: bool,      // show copy-content button
  language: 'markdown' | 'auto',  // editor mode
  storageKey: string,     // localStorage key for preview-mode persistence
  format: bool,           // show JSON/JSONL prettify button (auto-hidden for non-json files)
  onSave: async (filePath, content) => result,  // shows Save button
  onDelete: async (filePath) => result,         // shows Delete button (with window.confirm)
  onClose: () => void,    // shows Close button
});

// Lifecycle
panel.open(title, filePath, content);  // load a new file
panel.getContent();                    // current editor content
panel.destroy();                       // tear down (rare; usually open() replaces)
```

Used at `public/app.js:31-55` for the two panel instances.

## Toolbar buttons (visibility rules)

| Button | Shown when |
|---|---|
| `previewBtn` | `opts.preview` AND filePath ends in `.md`/`.mdx` |
| `wrapBtn` | always (default on for markdown, off otherwise) |
| `gotoLineBtn` | always |
| `formatBtn` | `opts.format` AND filePath ends in `.json`/`.jsonl` |
| `deleteBtn` | `opts.onDelete` provided |
| `saveBtn` | `opts.onSave` provided |
| `closeBtn` | `opts.onClose` provided |
| `copyPathBtn` | `opts.copyPath` |
| `copyContentBtn` | `opts.copyContent` |

The toolbar factory builds all configured buttons up front; `open()` toggles visibility based on file extension.

## Invariants

- **`open()` is the entry point — not the constructor**. Constructor creates an empty editor; `open()` swaps in content. Calling `open()` again on the same instance reuses the CodeMirror state via `editorView.dispatch({changes})`.
- **File watch lifecycle**: each `open()` unwatches the previous path, then watches the new one. `destroy()` unwatches but is rarely called. **If you spawn a new ViewerPanel without destroying the old one, both will keep watchers alive.**
- **The `_saving` flag debounces external-change reloads**: while a save is in flight, incoming `file-changed` events for the same path are ignored for 500 ms (avoids reload-loop after our own save).
- **`format` is a renderer-only transform** — it modifies the editor's document, doesn't write to disk. Use `save` separately if you want to persist.
- **Clipboard uses `window.api.writeClipboard`** as of PR #18 (Wayland fix). Don't fall back to `navigator.clipboard.writeText` for new copy actions.
- **Every markdown→`innerHTML` sink in this app must be `DOMPurify.sanitize(marked.parse(...))`, never `marked.parse(...)` alone.** `marked` doesn't filter URL schemes, so markdown syntax (`[x](javascript:...)`, `![x](javascript:...)`) survives into the DOM even when literal HTML is escaped first. Three sinks share this rule: `viewer-panel.js:397`, `viewer-toolbar.js:47`, and `jsonl-viewer.js`'s `renderJsonlText()` (transcript rendering, `public/jsonl-viewer.js`). `renderJsonlText()` additionally guards for `window.DOMPurify` being absent (falls back to the plain-text `escapeHtml()` path rather than handing marked's raw HTML to `innerHTML`).

## Non-obvious behaviors

- **Markdown preview mode is persisted per-storageKey** in `localStorage`. Memory uses `'markdownPreviewMode'`; .work-files uses `'workFilesPreviewMode'`.
- **Line-wrap default depends on file type**: markdown wraps, code doesn't. Wrap state is NOT persisted — resets per file.
- **`format` for `.jsonl` is intentionally non-standard**: each line is pretty-printed and joined with `\n---\n`. This produces human-readable output but is no longer valid JSON. The button is for *viewing*, not for converting files to a different format.
- **Cmd/Ctrl+S keybinding**: CodeMirror dispatches a `cm-save` custom event which the ViewerPanel listens for. Chromium's "Save Page" default is blocked globally in `viewer-toolbar.js:256` (`keydown` listener with `preventDefault`).
- **The toolbar API exposes button refs directly** (`toolbar.saveBtn`, `toolbar.formatBtn`, …). The ViewerPanel reads `null` checks instead of asking the toolbar — slightly leaky encapsulation, but harmless.

## If you change this, also check

- `public/app.js` panel constructors (2 callsites) — adding a new opt may need wiring there
- `eslint.config.js` if you expose a new cross-file global (e.g. `flashButtonText`, `toggleMarkdownPreview` are already declared)
- `test/dom-work-files-view.test.js` — covers the panel render path for the .work-files tab
- `public/file-panel.js` — has its own `fpViewerPanel = new ViewerPanel(...)` for the file-diff side panel; might need same opt
- If you add a new file-type-aware button, mirror the `_isJsonish()` / `_isMarkdown()` pattern with an `_isXyz()` helper rather than inlining the extension check

## Changes mode (issue #251)

`public/file-panel.js`'s side panel gained a third tab type, `'changes'`,
alongside the pre-existing `'file'` and `'diff'` (MCP) types on the same
per-session `filePanelState`. Full design (why it skips `ViewerPanel`, the
entry point, the no-polling refresh trigger, editing): `.ai/contexts/changes-view.md`.
User-facing behavior: `docs/changes-view.md`.

A local session's selected file is edited in one of the same CodeMirror views
this component builds its own editors from — `createMergeViewer` (default),
`createUnifiedMergeViewer` or `createEditableViewer`, picked by a three-way
mode button and persisted under `localStorage.changesDiffMode` (the MCP diff
tab's `filePanelDiffMode` is a separate key with a separate meaning). Three
things about that editor are not `ViewerPanel`'s:

- **The tab owns the instance, not the panel.** It lives on `tab.editorView`
  the way the MCP `'diff'` tab's does, keyed by path + staged + mode, and a
  re-render reuses it instead of rebuilding — the Changes tab re-renders on
  every busy→idle edge, which would otherwise land on the user's cursor.
  `destroyCurrentTab()` and `closeChangesDiff()` are what end its life.
- **Reading the buffer back is asymmetric.** A side-by-side `MergeView` is read
  from `view.b.state.doc`, the inline and plain views from `view.state.doc` —
  the same asymmetry `handleDiffAction` already navigates for the MCP tab.
- **The save is an IPC by session, not by path**: `gitChangesSave(sessionId,
  repoRelativePath, content, version)`, not `saveFileForPanel`. The renderer
  never holds an absolute path for a Changes row, and the version token is what
  stops it overwriting a file the session has written in the meantime.

`ViewerPanel`'s own protections have Changes-panel equivalents rather than
reuses, for the same reason: watching goes through `git-changes-watch` instead
of `watch-file` (session-keyed, no absolute path), and the in-flight save flag
lives on the tab instead of the component. One protection has no `ViewerPanel`
counterpart at all: an MCP-driven open replaces whatever tab is showing, so a
dirty Changes buffer is stashed on the session's panel state and restored when
the tab is reopened.

`Cmd/Ctrl+S` arrives as the same `cm-save` DOM event the bundle dispatches, and
the listener sits on `#changes-diff-view`, which is where `ViewerPanel` puts
its own (on its container).

The merge-view CSS in `public/style.css` is written for two hosts in one rule
list — `#file-panel-body` (MCP tab) and `#changes-diff-host` (Changes tab).
A new host means a new selector in those groups, not a copied block.

`createMergeViewer`'s `b` side and `createUnifiedMergeViewer` carry the editing
extensions a writing surface needs — `history()` (Ctrl/Cmd+Z), `defaultKeymap`,
`indentWithTab`, `indentOnInput`, `drawSelection` — and `cmSaveKeymap`, which is
what turns Ctrl/Cmd+S into the `cm-save` event the panels listen for. A
read-only viewer gets `cmSaveDomHandler` instead; an editable one must not have
both, or one keystroke raises two saves. `createUnifiedMergeViewer` takes
`{mergeControls}`: the MCP diff tab keeps the per-chunk Accept/Reject buttons,
the Changes panel turns them off. `test/codemirror-merge-editing.test.js`
drives all of this against the real CodeMirror under jsdom — a stub that
dispatches `cm-save` itself proves nothing about the keymap.

All three factories take an `onChange` callback, and `docChangeListener` in
`public/codemirror-setup.js` delivers it from a CodeMirror `updateListener` on
`docChanged` rather than from a DOM `input` listener on the editor: it fires
for typing, paste, undo/redo and programmatic dispatches alike, where a DOM
`input` event reports only the first two. A Save button whose enabled state is
computed from that callback is therefore still right after an undo.

## Gotchas

- **CodeMirror state holds DOM references** — calling `destroy()` then immediately `open()` on the SAME container works because `_createEditor` rebuilds it, but if you reorder this, the editor can dangle.
- **`format` swallows parse errors**: an invalid `.json` file shows a `!` flash on the button instead of an error message. By design (no toast system in this codebase yet).
- **`onDelete` doesn't refresh the list automatically** — the workFilesPanel wires a manual `removeWorkFileFromCache(filePath)` call in its `onDelete` handler. If you wire `onDelete` to another panel, add the equivalent refresh.
