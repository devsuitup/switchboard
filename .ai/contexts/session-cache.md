# Context: session-cache

**Purpose**: index every Claude session JSONL on disk into a queryable SQLite cache so the sidebar renders without re-scanning `~/.claude/projects/` and so search is full-text. Watches the projects directory for changes and refreshes incrementally.

## Key files

| File | LOC | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `db.js` | ~895 | SQLite (better-sqlite3) schema + prepared statements. Owns `session_cache`, `session_meta`, `cache_meta`, `settings`, `search_fts` (FTS5 + trigram tokenizer). |
| `session-cache.js` | ~690 | Indexer + watcher. Reads `~/.claude/projects/<folder>/*.jsonl` (+ subagents subdir), populates rows, emits projects-changed events. |
| `read-session-file.js` | ~420 | Streaming JSONL reader. `readSessionFile()` (full) + `readSessionDisplayHeader()` (256 KB / 500 lines — cheap header for huge files). |
| `encode-project-path.js` | 28 | `/path/to/project` → `-path-to-project` folder name. Mirrors Claude CLI's encoding. |
| `derive-project-path.js` | ~155 | Inverse: read `cwd` field from JSONL, derive original projectPath. **Collapses worktrees back to parent repo** via `resolveWorktreePath`. |

## Public surface

From `db.js`:

- **Sessions**: `getAllCached`, `getCachedByFolder(folder)`, `getCachedByParent(parentSessionId)`, `getCachedSession(sessionId)`, `upsertCachedSessions(rows[])`, `deleteCachedSession`, `deleteCachedFolder`
- **Meta**: `getMeta`, `getAllMeta`, `setName`, `toggleStar`, `setArchived` (session-level user state)
- **Folder meta**: `getFolderMeta`, `setFolderMeta(folder, projectPath, indexMtimeMs)` — tracks index freshness
- **Search**: `searchByType(type, query, limit, titleOnly)`, `upsertSearchEntries`, `deleteSearchType/Session/Folder`
- **Stats**: `getDailyActivity()` — `GROUP BY substr(modified, 1, 10)`, returns `[{date, messageCount, sessionCount}]` (heatmap source)
- **Settings**: `getSetting`, `setSetting`, `deleteSetting`
- **Misc**: `touchCachedModified(sessionId)` — 1-column UPDATE, cheap

From `session-cache.js`:

- `init(ctx)` — wire main process → cache (mainWindow ref for IPC events)
- `refreshFolder(folder, opts)` — opts `{files: Set<string>}` for targeted refresh (watcher payload). Defaults to full folder walk.
- `populateCacheFromFilesystem()` / `populateCacheViaWorker()` — initial scan / re-scan. The worker (`workers/scan-projects.js`) streams one `{type:'folder', result, current, total}` message per on-disk folder (plus a final `{type:'done'}`) instead of buffering the whole tree, so each folder is written to the DB and pushed to the renderer as soon as it's read — a large history no longer leaves the sidebar empty for the entire scan.
- `buildProjectsFromCache(showArchived)` — produces the sidebar payload (sorted, grouped by project, missing flag computed here)
- `notifyRendererProjectsChanged()` — throttled (~1.5s leading-edge) push to renderer
- `sendIndexingProgress()` (internal) — emits the `indexing-progress` IPC event, gated on `coldStart` (captured once at the top of `populateCacheViaWorker()` via `!isInitialScanComplete()`) and throttled to ~4 events/s (the first event and every `done:true` always pass). Feeds the renderer's first-run banner; see `.ai/contexts/ipc-bridge.md`. A `done:true` payload carrying `error` keeps the banner visible with the failure message instead of hiding it.

From `derive-project-path.js`: `deriveProjectPath(folderPath)`, `resolveWorktreePath(cwd)`.

## Invariants

- **`modified` is always ISO8601 string** (`2026-05-22T20:59:33.000Z`). `substr(modified, 1, 10)` is the canonical "day" derivation. Don't switch to epoch ms without migrating.
- **`session_cache.folder` is the encoded form** (`-home-jean-baptiste-workspace`). Use `encodeProjectPath()` to derive it from an absolute path.
- **WAL mode is enabled on SQLite open** — multiple readers OK; serialise writes. Concurrent writers will fail with `SQLITE_BUSY`.
- **`refreshFolder` is idempotent** — calling it twice with the same `opts.files` is safe; the `filePathToDbId` inverted index makes lookups O(1).
- **Header-only refresh** (via `readSessionDisplayHeader`) merges with the cached row to preserve `textContent`, `aiTitle`, etc. Don't overwrite cached fields with `null` from a partial read.
- **FTS entries follow `{id, type, folder, title, body}`** shape. `type` is one of `'session'`, `'subagent'`, `'memory'`, `'work-file'`. Mixing types within one upsert is fine.
- **`get-projects` never awaits the cold-start scan.** `main.js`'s handler fires `populateCacheViaWorker()` without `await` when the cache is empty, returning whatever's cached right now (still non-empty for project *names* — `buildProjectsFromCache` lists on-disk directories synchronously even with zero indexed sessions). Progressive fill-in relies entirely on `notifyRendererProjectsChanged()` firing per folder. Don't reintroduce the `await` — it's what caused the multi-minute blocking "Loading…" on a large `~/.claude/projects/`.
- **"Cache has rows" does not mean "initial scan finished".** The worker streams one DB write per folder, so killing the app mid-first-scan leaves `session_cache` partially populated. The authoritative signal is the `initial_scan_complete` settings key: written by `session-cache.js` only on the worker's final successful `done` message, backfilled once by migration v8 for pre-marker installs (their populated caches could only come from completed batch-write scans), cleared whenever the schema-reconciliation pass wipes the cache. `get-projects` treats "rows present but marker absent" as an interrupted scan: it resumes the background worker (safe — each folder message is delete-then-insert, so re-scanned folders never duplicate) and must NOT run the synchronous `reconcileCacheFromFilesystem()` sweep, which would re-parse every missing folder on the main thread. While the marker is absent, `buildProjectsFromCache`'s empty-dir fallback also skips `deriveProjectPath()` (per-folder readdir + 256 KB read) in favor of a zero-I/O best-effort decode of the folder name (`decodeProjectFolderBestEffort`), never persisted to `cache_meta`.

## Non-obvious behaviors

- **`resolveWorktreePath` collapses `<repo>/.worktrees/<name>` → `<repo>`** when the parent dir exists. Consequence: many `~/.claude/projects/-home-...workspace-myproject--worktrees-X` folders derive to the same projectPath. Callers must dedupe (see `get-work-files` IPC for the pattern).
- **Two-table sidebar payload**: projects are aggregated, but each session row has its own `subagentType` field. A `null`/empty `subagentType` means it's a parent session; anything else (e.g. `'general-purpose'`, `'researcher'`) marks a subagent.
- **`fs.watch` debouncing**: the watcher batches per-folder events in a `pendingChanges = Map<folder, Set<filename> | true>` for ~200 ms before flushing to `refreshFolder`. A `true` value means "full walk needed" (rare path).
- **A session's title comes from its first *real* user turn, and a transcript without one is not indexed.** `classifyUserText()` in `read-session-file.js` sorts each user record into `prompt` / `command` / `skip`. `skip` is local-command bookkeeping (`<bash-input>`, `<bash-stdout>`, `<local-command-caveat>`, `<local-command-stdout>` — the CLI writes a command's own output back as a `user` record too); `command` is a bare slash-command record, recognised by a `<command-name>` tag next to a `<command-message>` or `<command-args>` one — the CLI writes both orders (`<command-name>` first for `/clear`, `<command-message>` first for `/auto-compact` and `/pre-compact`), so neither tag can be required to come first. The `skip` test is anchored to the start of the record: a real prompt that *quotes* `<local-command-stdout>` (a pasted transcript excerpt) is a turn, and skipping it can leave a session with no indexable prompt at all. This matters because **`/clear` opens a NEW jsonl and writes only that bookkeeping into it**; `/model`, by contrast, is written into the transcript that is already open, so it is a summary candidate only when it lands before any real prompt. Taking a `command` record as the summary therefore (a) titled every session started by `/clear` "`/clear clear </com…`" (the raw tags survive `cleanDisplayName`'s tag strip as a truncated fragment) and (b) indexed the bookkeeping-only transcript as a phantom sidebar session that the user never started. A `command` record is now a *fallback* title, used only when the transcript also holds an assistant turn (`/code-review high` → a real headless-command session); with no assistant turn both readers return `null` and nothing is indexed, matching how a brand-new session stays out of the sidebar until its first prompt. Rows written by the pre-fix parser cannot self-heal — the phantom ones sit on a file that never changes again, and the real ones keep the bad title because the header-only refresh path only overwrites a summary it can re-derive — so `db.js` migration **v9** purges rows whose summary starts with `<command-name>`, `<command-message>` or `<local-command-stdout>` — from `session_cache`, the three search tables and `session_metrics` (a phantom's file is never re-read, so its metrics would inflate the heatmap and the totals forever) — plus the `cache_meta` gate of their folders, which makes the next reconcile re-read exactly those files. The whole purge runs in one transaction: it cannot be resumed, since the relaunch that follows an interrupted run is already at db_version 9 and no longer matches the rows it dropped.
- **Stats `firstSessionDate`** is computed from `MIN(modified)`, not `MIN(created)`. Old sessions touched by recent reads keep their original `created` but their `modified` reflects the latest indexing — by design (the heatmap measures activity, not creation).

- **`main.js`'s `ctx.db` is a hand-built allow-list, not a spread of `db.js`.** `main.js` (~line 323) passes `sessionCache.init({ ..., db: { deleteCachedFolder, getCachedByFolder, upsertCachedSessions, ... } })` as an explicit object literal — it does **not** do `db: require('./db')`. If you add a new function to `db.js` and call it from `session-cache.js` via `ctx.db.<name>`, but forget to add it to both this literal *and* the `require('./db')` destructure at the top of `main.js`, `ctx.db.<name>` is `undefined`. The resulting `TypeError` is thrown inside `populateCacheViaWorker`'s `worker.on('message')` handler, which has no `try/catch` — it lands on stderr (not `electron-log`) and silently aborts the cold-start indexing write loop. Symptom: the log shows `Indexing N projects…` but never `Indexed N sessions across …`, and the affected table stays empty. Guarded by `test/main-ctx-db-wiring.test.js` (static source-grep asserting the allow-list ⊇ every `ctx.db.*` dereference in `session-cache.js`) — run it whenever you touch this boundary, but also update the allow-list by hand since the test only catches *missing* entries, not the intent.

- **`search` IPC is routed through a dedicated worker thread, with a bounded query.** Historically `ipcMain.handle('search', ...)` ran the `better-sqlite3` FTS5 `MATCH` query synchronously on the Electron main process — a long pasted string (e.g. a GitLab MR URL) became a ~58-trigram phrase intersect that pinned the main thread for up to ~60 s and froze the whole app (witnessed 2026-06-22). Two guards now exist: (1) `searchByType()` in `db.js` truncates the query to `FTS_QUERY_MAX_CHARS` (48) before building the MATCH expression; (2) the `search` IPC goes through `searchViaWorker` (`search-worker-client.js` + `workers/search-query.js`) so even a slow query can't block IPC dispatch. The client falls back to the synchronous main-thread `searchByType` only when the worker isn't ready (first-launch race, or circuit-breaker open after repeated worker failures) — the length cap makes that fallback safe. Protocol logic (correlation IDs, drain, backoff, restart storm guard) is unit-tested in `test/search-worker-protocol.test.js`; the cap in `test/db-search-query-bound.test.js`.

- **A manual `/compact` leaves a second transcript ("mirror") for the same session; it is merged on `bridgeSessionId`, not on file order, and NEITHER file is discarded (issue #197).** The CLI writes a `{"type":"bridge-session","bridgeSessionId":"cse_..."}` bookkeeping record into a transcript once bridging is established; both the pre-compaction file and the mirror it continues into carry the SAME `bridgeSessionId`. Measured on a real pair (16 MB parent + 3.1 MB mirror, same folder): **neither size nor first-event date tells them apart** — the mirror is *smaller* (it starts fresh at the compaction point) and *looks newer* (its first event is the compaction timestamp, later than the parent's). The parent's very last line is a `{"type":"continued-in","continuedInSessionId":"<mirror>"}` marker, after which the parent file goes quiet; the mirror keeps receiving new lines afterward — **the CLI keeps writing to the mirror, not the parent, once compaction happens.** `continued-in` is NOT a safe merge signal by itself: the same parent file carried a *second* `continued-in` record earlier, pointing at a transcript with a completely different `bridgeSessionId` (a genuinely independent session) — only a `bridgeSessionId` match is trustworthy.
  - **First cut of this fix kept the earliest file and dropped the mirror outright — wrong, caught in review before merge.** Given the CLI keeps writing to the mirror, discarding it forever would make every post-compaction message invisible to the cache: a session that compacts and keeps working loses all *later* activity, which is a worse failure mode than the double-count it replaces (double-count is a visible cost anomaly; silent loss of live activity is not visible at all, and this machine compacts routinely — nominal case, not an edge case). The design below is a real union instead.
  - **The mirror duplicates its predecessor's tail verbatim — same timestamps — then continues with genuinely new content.** This is the fact that makes an exact, cheap union possible: the overlap is bounded exactly by the predecessor's `modified` (its last real-message timestamp, already computed and stored). Anything in the mirror at or before that timestamp is the recopied duplicate; anything after is new.
  - **Detection is full-read-only.** `readSessionFile()` extracts `bridgeSessionId` from the first `bridge-session` record it sees; `readSessionDisplayHeader()` (the incremental/header-only refresh path, capped at 256 KB / 500 lines) never attempts it, because the record is not reliably near the head of the file — on the real mirror fixture it sat at byte ~3.08 MB of a 3.08 MB file, past the cap. A `readSessionFile()` full read still happens once per file, the first time it's seen (the "NEW file" branch of `refreshFolder`), so the value is captured and then persisted in `session_cache.bridgeSessionId`, carried forward unchanged by every later header-only merge.
  - **Every member of a bridgeSessionId group keeps its own `session_cache` row** (own `fileMtime`, own incremental refresh — completely unchanged machinery, so a frozen 16 MB parent is never re-read just because its mirror changed). `mergeBridgeGroups(existingRows, freshRows, reread)` in `read-session-file.js` (shared with `workers/scan-projects.js`) groups top-level sessions (never subagents — `parentSessionId` set is always excluded) by `bridgeSessionId`, sorts by `created` ascending, and marks every member except the earliest with `session_cache.mergedIntoSessionId = <earliest member's sessionId>`. Each non-winner's own `messageCount`/`textContent`/`session_metrics` are recomputed via `reread(sessionId, cutoff)` — a second call to `readSessionFile()` with `opts.dedupeSinceTimestamp` set to its immediate predecessor's `modified` — so its contribution excludes exactly the recopied overlap and nothing else.
  - **A cached row is never, on its own, proof that its contribution is already deduplicated — the discovery-order bug caught in review before merge.** `mergeBridgeGroups` decides whether to call `reread()` by comparing a member's *recorded* `mergedIntoSessionId` against the role (winner, or child of a specific winner) just computed for it this pass — **not** by whether the member came from `freshRows` or `existingRows`. An earlier draft skipped `reread` for any already-cached row and merely patched its `mergedIntoSessionId` (a "touch"). That is provably wrong whenever the cached row was never derived against a cutoff in the first place: **reachable mechanically** through `refreshFolder`'s targeted path — a watcher flush can name only the mirror as dirty (its sibling not yet in `cachedSessions` at all, e.g. a project folder the cold-start scan hasn't reached yet), so `mergeBridgeGroups` sees a group of exactly one member and applies no cutoff; the mirror's row is written with its full, undeduplicated `messageCount`. A *later* pass that discovers the parent for the first time must then re-derive that already-cached mirror, or the double-count this fix exists to close survives unchanged, just reached from the other file. Fixed by keying the reread decision on `mergedIntoSessionId !== computedRole` for every member, fresh or not — proven red beforehand by `test/read-session-file-bridge-session.test.js`'s "already cached WITHOUT a cutoff" cases and `test/session-cache-bridge-dedup.test.js`'s two-pass (`mirror` then `parent`) reproduction. The same reasoning runs in reverse for the winner: if a group's earliest file is deleted (a real path — session deletion), its former child is promoted to winner on the very next pass, but its stored contribution is still cutoff-filtered against a predecessor that no longer exists and now under-counts — so the winner itself is re-read in full (`cutoff = null`) whenever its recorded `mergedIntoSessionId` is non-null, checked even for a group that has shrunk to one member. The only case that is genuinely free of a re-read is a member whose recorded `mergedIntoSessionId` already equals its just-computed role: that row's stored contribution was necessarily derived against this exact cutoff on some prior pass, so a frozen parent stays untouched on every routine call once the group has settled.
  - **`mergedIntoSessionId` rows are excluded from sidebar/session-count listings, but count fully in token/message aggregates.** `buildProjectsFromCache()` skips any row with `mergedIntoSessionId` set and rolls its `messageCount` and `modified` up onto the row it merged into (so the sidebar shows one entry, with a `modified` that reflects the mirror's live activity, not the frozen parent's). `db.js`'s `getTotalCounts().totalSessions` excludes them the same way (`AND mergedIntoSessionId IS NULL`). `session_metrics`-based aggregates (`getDailyMetrics`, `getDailyModelTokens`, `getModelUsage`, and `getTotalCounts`'s message/token/tool-call sums) need **no** such exclusion: parent and mirror insert under distinct `sessionId`s with non-overlapping timestamp ranges (the cutoff guarantees this), so a plain `SUM(...) GROUP BY date` already adds them correctly. `getDailyActivity()` (the older, `session_cache`-based heatmap source) also self-corrects on `messageCount` for the same reason, but its `sessionCount` column will count a merged mirror as one more "session" on the day it's active — a pre-existing, disclosed approximation (that function already explicitly aggregates "ALL rows, parents and subagents alike"), not something this fix newly breaks.
  - **Residual gaps, named rather than hidden**: (1) the transcript viewer (`read-session-jsonl`) still resolves a sessionId to exactly one physical file, so opening the *merged* (winner) session shows only its own pre-compaction content — post-compaction content is visible only by separately finding the mirror's own row/search hit, not through a stitched view. (2) FTS search body for the winner is built from its own `textContent` only (pre-compaction text); the mirror keeps its own, separate search entry (its post-compaction `textContent`), so post-compaction text is findable but surfaces as a second, unlabelled-in-the-sidebar search hit rather than under the visible session's own entry. Both are scoped follow-ups, not silently-accepted data loss — nothing here drops tokens, messages, or the ability to eventually find the content, only the "one unified view" polish.
  - **Winner tie-break is `created`, then `sessionId` string order, and can be picked "wrong" in a narrow case**: if a session is short enough that the mirror's recopied context window covers its *entire* history, the mirror's own unfiltered `created` can tie the true parent's. The sessionId string tie-break is then arbitrary. This does not affect correctness of totals (the group still partitions all activity with no double-count either way) — only which of the two sessionIds ends up as the visible "primary" one. Not fixed here; flagged for whoever hits it.
  - **Open question #1 (absence)**: a transcript with no `bridgeSessionId` is never grouped with anything — `mergeBridgeGroups` only builds a group when the field is a non-empty string, so old-format transcripts and any layout that never emits the field simply keep their own row, exactly like today.
  - **Open question #2 (which file keeps being written)**: established by measurement above — the mirror, not the parent. That is exactly why the mirror is never discarded: dropping it would silently erase every message written after the compaction, for as long as the session keeps being used. The union design keeps both files' rows, forever, each independently refreshed.
  - **Open question #3 (existing databases)**: repaired on the next index pass, not left alone. `bridgeSessionId` and `mergedIntoSessionId` are added purely via the schema-reconciliation block (not a numbered migration — deliberately, to avoid coupling `migrations.length` to unrelated migration-ordering tests; see `db-schema-reconcile.test.js`'s "foreign higher-version" precedent for why reconciliation is the version-independent mechanism). Their absence sets `mustReindex = true`, which wipes `session_cache` + `cache_meta` + the `initial_scan_complete` marker, forcing every folder through the now-merging indexer on the next scan — the same repair path already used when `fileMtime` (v7) or the fork subagent columns (v4) were introduced.

## Remote SSH hosts (issue #201)

A declared SSH host's `~/.claude/projects` is mirrored into
`<dataDir>/remote/<alias>/projects/` and indexed as a **second projects root**.
Observation only: a remote session is read, searched and counted, never resumed
or deleted from here.

- **The local path is unchanged when no host is declared.** `remote-index.js`
  `start()` returns false before touching anything if `enabledHosts()` is empty:
  no `setInterval`, no ssh, no mirror directory. `session-cache.js`'s
  `remoteRoots` map stays empty, so `resolveFolderDir()` is `path.join(PROJECTS_DIR, folder)`
  and `buildProjectsFromCache`'s root list has exactly one entry — the same
  `readdirSync` it always did. Proven by `test/remote-index.test.js` (a transport
  and a `sync` that throw on any call) and `test/remote-indexing-e2e.test.js`.

- **Folder keys are `<alias>::<folder>`.** `encodeProjectPath` emits only
  `[a-zA-Z0-9-]` (`encode-project-path.js:5`), so `::` cannot occur in a local
  key and a remote key can never collide with one. `parseFolderKey`
  (`remote-hosts.js`) refuses a prefix that is not a valid alias, so a local
  folder whose name happens to contain `::` still reads as local. Local rows keep
  their current unprefixed form — nothing migrates.

- **The primary key is NOT namespaced, and that risk is accepted here in
  writing.** `session_meta.sessionId` and `session_cache.sessionId` stay global
  PKs (`db.js:51`, `db.js:60`). Two hosts whose CLIs generate the same session id
  would overwrite each other's star, title and archive state, and one host's row
  would shadow the other's in the sidebar. The ids are CLI-generated UUIDv4 and no
  collision exists in the measured data (255 transcripts on the probed host, 2026-09-07).
  Migrating the PK to `(host, sessionId)` touches every table, every IPC payload
  and every renderer id — it is not worth doing before a second host exists.
  **If you ever see two sessions fighting over a star or a title, this is why.**

- **The mirror is pulled, never watched.** `fs.watch` cannot cross SSH
  (inotify/FSEvents/ReadDirectoryChangesW are kernel-local), and the local
  watcher at `main.js` `startProjectsWatcher()` is deliberately not pointed at the
  mirror — it would fire on our own `scp` writes, not on remote activity. A timer
  drives it instead, floored at 60 s: a tighter loop costs latency and VPS CPU for
  a "where is my session at" use case that does not need it.

- **One `ssh` inventory, then only the deltas.** `remote-transport.js` runs
  `find .claude/projects -type f -name '*.jsonl' -printf '%T@	%s	%P
'` over
  a single ssh call and compares `(size, mtimeMs)` against
  `<dataDir>/remote/<alias>/inventory.json`. `rsync` is not used because it is
  absent on this Windows machine (measured); `ssh2` is not used because it would
  drag an optional native addon into the `electron-builder` pipeline. First pull
  moves the whole tree (249 MB on the probed host) as one `scp` per file at
  concurrency 4 — slow once, near-free afterwards.

- **Every child process is bounded and reaped.** Each `ssh`/`scp` gets a timeout
  that `SIGKILL`s it, every child is registered in a live set, and
  `remoteIndexer.stop()` (wired to `before-quit`) kills whatever is left. On
  Windows a child outlives the death of its launcher — on 2026-09-06 an unbounded
  load left 24 orphans at 100% CPU on this machine.

- **A failing host degrades quietly and leaves the mirror alone.**
  `syncMirror` throws before mutating anything if the inventory call fails; a
  partial fetch skips the deletion pass *and* keeps the vanished files in the
  manifest, so the deletion is still owed on the next healthy run rather than
  silently forgotten. `remote-index.js` catches per host, so one dead host does
  not stop its peers or the local scan.

- **The mirror is indexed off the main thread.** `workers/scan-projects.js` takes
  `folderPrefix` and a `folders` subset in `workerData`, and
  `sessionCache.scanFoldersViaWorker` writes each folder result through the same
  delete-then-insert path as the cold-start scan. Parsing 249 MB on the main
  thread would freeze the UI; `refreshFolder` is deliberately not the remote path.

- **A remote project is never "missing".** `buildProjectsFromCache` sets
  `missing: false` for any aliased row. Probing the local filesystem for
  `/srv/supervision` would flag every remote project missing and offer it to the
  missing-project remap UI, which rewrites transcripts for a path this machine
  never owned. Sidebar grouping is keyed on `alias + projectPath`, not
  `projectPath` alone, so two hosts holding the same absolute path stay two groups.

- **Switchboard never stores, reads or displays an SSH credential.** A host row
  is an alias and a label. Resolution (user, port, key, agent, proxy) stays in the
  user's `~/.ssh/config`, which is already on the sensitive-path denylist
  (`ipc-path-validator.js:38`, `main.js:732`) and stays there. The alias is passed
  as its own argv element, never concatenated into a shell string; a remote
  relative path is validated by `isSafeRelPath` before it is joined onto a local
  directory or handed to `scp` (OpenSSH 9 runs scp over SFTP, where quoting would
  become part of the name — the validation is the guard, not quoting).
