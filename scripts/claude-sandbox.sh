#!/usr/bin/env bash
# claude-sandbox.sh — launch Claude Code inside a bubblewrap (bwrap) sandbox.
#
# Used by the "Sandbox" session option (Linux only). The sandboxed process
# sees:
#   read-only:   /usr, /etc, the resolved claude binary's directory, the
#                resolved node interpreter's directory, $NVM_DIR, and the
#                podman API socket when one is live
#   read-write:  the project directory (cwd), Claude's own config/state
#                (~/.claude, ~/.claude.json, ~/.config/claude,
#                ~/.cache/claude, ~/.local/share/claude), and any extra
#                directories passed via $SWITCHBOARD_SANDBOX_BINDS
#                (colon-separated — Switchboard forwards "Additional
#                Directories" and the project root here; paths containing
#                ':' or a newline cannot be transported and are dropped on
#                the app side)
#   network:     shared with the host — Claude needs the API, and the
#                Switchboard IDE bridge listens on localhost
#
# Everything else — the rest of $HOME in particular — does not exist inside
# the sandbox. This is a FILESYSTEM boundary only: environment variables are
# inherited (no --clearenv) and the network namespace is the host's. Note
# that ~/.claude itself carries credentials and all projects' transcripts.
# See docs/sandbox.md for the full isolation contract.
#
# Host side effects: none until the sandbox is known to be constructible. The
# bwrap pre-flight runs against the binds that already exist, and only after it
# passes are missing state dirs created (a bind mount needs an existing source).
# A launch that bwrap refuses outright leaves $HOME untouched.
#
# Debugging: set SWITCHBOARD_SANDBOX_DEBUG=1 to print the resolved binary,
# every bind, and the full bwrap invocation before launch. From Switchboard,
# put `SWITCHBOARD_SANDBOX_DEBUG=1` in the session's Pre-launch Command.
#
# Usage: claude-sandbox.sh [claude args...]
