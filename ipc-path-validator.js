// ipc-path-validator.js — path validation helpers for IPC file-access handlers.
//
// Two layers of defense:
//   1. isSensitivePath   — denylist for well-known credential / secret files.
//      Used by the file-panel handlers (read-file-for-panel, save-file-for-panel,
//      watch-file) which intentionally accept arbitrary project paths (OSC 8
//      hyperlinks from terminal output). Blocking a static denylist is lighter
//      than allowlisting because the legitimate surface is unbounded.
//
//   2. resolveAllowedMemoryPath — strict allowlist for memory handlers
//      (read-memory, save-memory) that should only touch ~/.claude/ or active
//      project directories. Returns the resolved path (or null), not a
//      boolean: the caller's read/write MUST run against that returned
//      value, never against a path it re-derives itself, or the disk
//      resolution this function did is moot. isAllowedMemoryPath is the
//      boolean form, for callers that only need the yes/no answer.
//
//   3. isKnownProjectRoot — exact-match check used by the worktree handlers
//      (delete-worktree, worktree-status), whose regex only validates the
//      *shape* of a path, not that it points at a project this install has
//      ever heard of.
//
// All three also resolve on disk (resolveOnDisk) when the target exists, and
// check that resolved location too — path.resolve() alone does not survive a
// symlink. See .ai/contexts/ipc-bridge.md, "IPC path-guard inventory".
